<h1 align="center">Create NTL Redone<br></h1>

<p>Create NTL Redone is a mod of Create (meaning that you'll have to replace this with your Create mod, but I'm also working on an addon mod).</p>
<p>This currently adds nothing directly, but removes some track placement limits and changes the max placement distance to 128 blocks. Make sure to get your render distance high enough tho!</p>
<p><b>EXPERIMENTAL! I DO NOT FAFING CARE IF YOUR WORLD IS GONE AFTER USING THIS. BACK YOUR WORLD UP!</b></p>
<p>This should work cross-compatible with normal Create, meaning that you should be able to use this to create your tracks and then just use normal Create for everything else.</p>
<p><b>Want this to be ported to another version? Ask me! Click on Issues, create an issue and select "Port to version"!</b></p>
